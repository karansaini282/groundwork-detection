# street-sign-detection
Use http://customvision.ai to detect US street signs

## Why
Street signs are part of a city's asset management mandate. Maintenance of street signage is key municipal operation that ensures traffic safety. Street signs are also important for the the safe navigation of Autonomous vehicles

## What
Develop a computer vision model that is trained on US street signage and test it on street view imagery.

## How
Use http://customvision.ai - an easy-to-use computer vision toolkit developed by Microsoft.

## When
### Week 1 - Orientation
- Learn how to use http://customvision.ai to develop quick computer vision applications.
- Learn how to collect street view imagery at a citywide scale using [Google Street View API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro) and [Open Street Cam](https://github.com/Streets-Data-Collaborative/osc-tools)
- Develop a simple street signage data specification.

### Week 2 - Train & Test
- Upload street signage imagery to customvision interface
- Label street signs from the uploaded imagery.
- Test the accuracy of your trained street sign model.
- Iterate towards better precision and recall.

### Week 3 - Results
- Parse results from customvision output into a more readable format.
- Use the trained model to survey street signs for a specific geography (small neighborhood or entire city)
- Prepare blog to document your journey. What worked, What did not. Ideas for future improvement / applications etc.
